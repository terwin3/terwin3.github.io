	    <h3>About Me</h3>
		<body>
		<p>Here's a little bit about myself. My name is Travis and last year I started school doing web design classes and I didn't go this last semester so recently I had the feeling to start my own designing business, I aspire to be an amazing developer to satisfy all companies or even bands websites needs. Soon I will have a portfolio on the site casing my work. I've always wanted to learn coding and when I started learning it I figured out what my calling was, to design the best websites I can. There is nothing else I want to do in life.</p>
