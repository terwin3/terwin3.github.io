<div class="main">
<p>In 2015 I had this idea to start creating websites, doing what I love to service clients and build them a website that would increase their revenue, fans, or their product knowability. I've always had the feeling to create and code and so in 2014 I started going to school for it, almost a year later I stopped going and after a few months I didn't know what I wanted to do. Then I had an idea, become a freelance designer. I wanted to do it sooner, but thinking "where would I start?", but I began searching and realized it just matters what you can do for your clients and how you can improve their business with the skills and talents you have. I strive to do what is best for the client, their needs are my top priority. I am passionate for what I do, I love to create and code, those two things are what keeps me going. </p>

      <h3 id="Process">The Process</h3>
<div class="main">
      <p>I start by getting information about the clients business and their message then get a feel for their style and what type of demographics they want to reach out to. I ask questions such as: What is your business? Whatâ€™s your message? What makes you different from others in your industry? What do you want in your website? What do you not want? You set the guidelines and I'll design by them. I'll look adn show you other websites around the industry you're in and show you ideas you may like. Then I'll create a mockup and review with the client which means I'll show an example of what the website will look like when it's finished. If the client is disatisfied I'll come up with something new and work with the client until they're satisfied and happy with the design. After all of that I will get to work on the design and development stages of creating it and testing it! I'll make sure its friendly, easy to use, and attractive!
