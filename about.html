<p>In 2015 I had this idea to start creating websites, doing what I love to service clients and build them a website that would increase their revenue, fans, or their product knowability. I've always had the feeling to create and code and so in 2014 I started going to school for it, almost a year later I stopped going and after a few months I didn't know what I wanted to do. Then I had an idea, become a freelance designer. I wanted to do it sooner, but thinking "where would I start?", but I began searching and realized it just matters what you can do for your clients and how you can improve their business with the skills and talents you have. I strive to do what is best for the client, their needs are my top priority. I am passionate for what I do, I love to create and code, those two things are what keeps me going. </p>
